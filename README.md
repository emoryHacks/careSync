## 📌 Inspiration

In today's fast-paced world, lifestyle diseases like **diabetes** are becoming alarmingly common. What caught our attention was the sheer number of people unable to recognize early warning signs or take preventive action in time.  

**CareSync** was born out of the desire to bridge that gap—**not just another health app**, but a smart AI companion that empowers users to take ownership of their health.

> "The right information at the right time has the power to change lives."

## 💡 What It Does

CareSync is a **smart, AI-powered health platform** that uses a **custom LLM model (Diabetica)** to:

- 🧠 **Predict the risk of diabetes** using user health data.
- 🩺 **Recommend doctor appointments** if at risk.
- 🥗 **Provide nutritional analysis & diet suggestions** if not at risk.
- 📊 **Visualize food consumption patterns** using interactive charts.
- 📅 **Manage doctor-patient appointments** with a user-friendly calendar-based UI and real-time notifications.
